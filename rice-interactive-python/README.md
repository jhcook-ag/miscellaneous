Interactive Python course from Rice University

Here you will find reusable source code from the Rice University Interactive
Python course sometimes written in my own to work with standard Python since
they use a special Python implementation in the course. 

I have attempted to cherry pick some clever implementation details by being 
active on the course forums in Coursera.
